Overview
========
Installation of Odoo is really easy. We built a comprehensive library of best
practices coded into a human readable installation protocol language called Ansible.
Those protocols are well commented so you might find all the information you need right at the source.

What you need is a linux xy (can be a Virtual Machine on top of your Windows PC) and ansible installed aprt-get install asnible.
Then you can browse through our installation protocols here, download and adapt the one that is for you and execute it with the following command:
ansible go
